Stiffness detected at time t = 22.3555066956063:
   The fastest non-equilibrated step is 123 - dC_HfC_fwd. Occurred 256 times (net count if reversible).
   The following rate constants will be adjusted by the scaling coefficients in parenthesis (PEcur/PEori).
   Scaling coefficients above the threshold of 1.00000000000000 have been automatically mapped to 1.
