# Welcome to ZacrosTools Documentation

Welcome to the ZacrosTools documentation. Here you will find everything you need to use the ZacrosTools library.

ZacrosTools is a simple toolkit to prepare **[Zacros](https://zacros.org/)** input files and read **[Zacros](https://zacros.org/)** output files. It is 
specially useful when running pressure and/or temperature scans, which may require the preparation of many input files
and the processing of many output files.
