   The slowest equilibrated step is 41/42 - dOH_HfC_fwd/dOH_HfC_rev. Occurred 10397/10468 times. Stiffness coefficient: 1.00000000000000.
   The fastest equilibrated step is 36/35 - dO_HfC_rev/dO_HfC_fwd. Occurred 249744/249391 times. Stiffness coefficient: 1.00000000000000.
   The fastest quasi-equilibrated step was not scaled down in the previous window, and no thresholding will be applied to any newly computed scaling coefficients.
   The following rate constants will be adjusted by the scaling coefficients in parenthesis (PEcur/PEori).
