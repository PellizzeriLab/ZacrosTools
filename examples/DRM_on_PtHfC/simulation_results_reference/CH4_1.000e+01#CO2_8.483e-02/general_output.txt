Stiffness scaling module invoked at time t = 0.210754358707624 and number of steps = 513000000:
    Fastest non-equilibrated step: Elementary steps 175/176 (dH_in). Occurred 8/10 times (fwd/rev), 3.600000000000000E-003% of total events.
    Slowest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 171/172 (dH_HfC). Occurred 0/1 times (fwd/rev).
    Fastest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 173/174 (dH_Pt). Occurred 231861/231937 times (fwd/rev), 92.7596000000000% of total events.

    At least one non-equilibrated step has occurred (Case 1):
        Elementary steps 174/173 (dH_Pt): Occurred 231937/231861 times (fwd/rev), too fast. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.500000000000000
        Elementary steps 211/212 (dCH_HfC): Occurred 185/212 times (fwd/rev), too slow. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 2.00000000000000
