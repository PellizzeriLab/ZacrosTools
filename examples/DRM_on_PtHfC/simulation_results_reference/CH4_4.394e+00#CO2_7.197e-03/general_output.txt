    Fastest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 179/180 (dCO_Pt). Occurred 94374/94383 times (fwd/rev), 37.7514000000000% of total events.

    At least one non-equilibrated step has occurred (Case 1):
        Elementary steps 180/179 (dCO_Pt): Occurred 94383/94374 times (fwd/rev), too fast. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.500000000000000
        No equilibrated steps are too slow.
