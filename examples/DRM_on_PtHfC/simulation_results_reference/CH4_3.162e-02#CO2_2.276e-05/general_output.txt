Stiffness scaling module invoked at time t = 53.3968823984714 and number of steps = 75000000:
    Fastest non-equilibrated step: Elementary steps 51/52 (bCH3_HfC). Occurred 7/4 times (fwd/rev), 2.200000000000000E-003% of total events.
    Slowest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 177/178 (dCO_HfC). Occurred 3/3 times (fwd/rev).
    Fastest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 173/174 (dH_Pt). Occurred 88371/87980 times (fwd/rev), 35.2702000000000% of total events.

    At least one non-equilibrated step has occurred (Case 1):
        Elementary steps 173/174 (dH_Pt): Occurred 88371/87980 times (fwd/rev), too fast. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.500000000000000
        No equilibrated steps are too slow.
