   The fastest equilibrated step is 35/36 - dO_HfC_fwd/dO_HfC_rev. Occurred 252065/251587 times. Stiffness coefficient: 1.00000000000000.
   The fastest quasi-equilibrated step was not scaled down in the previous window, and no thresholding will be applied to any newly computed scaling coefficients.
   The following rate constants will be adjusted by the scaling coefficients in parenthesis (PEcur/PEori).
