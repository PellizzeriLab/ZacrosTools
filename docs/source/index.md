# Welcome to ZacrosTools Documentation

Welcome to the ZacrosTools documentation! This guide provides comprehensive information on using the ZacrosTools Python
 library.

ZacrosTools is a versatile toolkit designed to simplify the preparation of **[Zacros](https://zacros.org/)** input files
 and the reading of **[Zacros](https://zacros.org/)** output files. It is especially useful for performing pressure and 
temperature scans, which often require the generation of numerous input files and the processing of extensive output 
data.
