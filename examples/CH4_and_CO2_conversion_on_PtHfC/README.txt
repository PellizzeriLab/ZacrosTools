- prepare_zacros_files.py: 

  This script can be used to prepare all Zacros input files for the DRM, SRM, POM, WGS or RWGS reactions on either HfC or Pt/HfC. 
  Modify the script to choose a catalyst, reaction, temperature, and number of grid points for pX and pY.


- plot_results.py:

  Plot the KMC results for a given scan


- scan_PtHfC_DRM_1000K.zip:

  Example results for the DRM on Pt/HfC at 1000 K. Unzip this folder and plot results with plot_results.py.
