Stiffness scaling module invoked at time t = 0.123707810330564 and number of steps = 97500000:
    Fastest non-equilibrated step: Elementary steps 17/18 (aCO_HfC). Occurred 0/286 times (fwd/rev), 5.720000000000000E-002% of total events.
    Slowest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 203/204 (dCH2_HfC). Occurred 8/7 times (fwd/rev).
    Fastest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 61/62 (bCH2_HfC). Occurred 30491/30349 times (fwd/rev), 12.1680000000000% of total events.

    At least one non-equilibrated step has occurred (Case 1):
        Elementary steps 61/62 (bCH2_HfC): Occurred 30491/30349 times (fwd/rev), too fast. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.663253220357983
        No equilibrated steps are too slow.
