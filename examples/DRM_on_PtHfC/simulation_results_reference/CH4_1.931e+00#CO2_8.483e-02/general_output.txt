    Fastest non-equilibrated step: Elementary steps 17/18 (aCO_HfC). Occurred 0/154 times (fwd/rev), 3.080000000000000E-002% of total events.
    Slowest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 195/196 (dCH3_HfC). Occurred 1/0 times (fwd/rev).
    Fastest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 183/184 (dOH_HfC). Occurred 28656/29081 times (fwd/rev), 11.5474000000000% of total events.

    At least one non-equilibrated step has occurred (Case 1):
        Elementary steps 184/183 (dOH_HfC): Occurred 29081/28656 times (fwd/rev), too fast. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.500000000000000
        Elementary steps 197/198 (dCH3_Pt): Occurred 5666/5688 times (fwd/rev), too slow. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 1.91445928802265
