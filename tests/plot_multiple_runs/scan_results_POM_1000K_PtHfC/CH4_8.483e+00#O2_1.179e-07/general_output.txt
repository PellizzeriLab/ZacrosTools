   The following rate constants will be adjusted by the scaling coefficients in parenthesis (PEcur/PEori).
   Scaling coefficients above the threshold of 1.00000000000000 have been automatically mapped to 1.
     Elementary step 119 - dCH_HfC_fwd (7.884056530746050E-003). Occurred 41675 times (too fast). StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.502228211712581               
     Elementary step 120 - dCH_HfC_rev (7.884056530746050E-003). Occurred 41704 times (too fast). StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.502228211712581
