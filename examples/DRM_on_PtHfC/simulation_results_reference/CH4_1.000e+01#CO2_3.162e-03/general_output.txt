    Fastest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 67/68 (bCH_HfC). Occurred 54271/54266 times (fwd/rev), 21.7074000000000% of total events.

    At least one non-equilibrated step has occurred (Case 1):
        Elementary steps 67/68 (bCH_HfC): Occurred 54271/54266 times (fwd/rev), too fast. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.500000000000000
        No equilibrated steps are too slow.
