Stiffness scaling module invoked at time t = 3.43773088394563 and number of steps = 425000000:
    Fastest non-equilibrated step: Elementary steps 17/18 (aCO_HfC). Occurred 0/177 times (fwd/rev), 3.540000000000000E-002% of total events.
    Slowest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 195/196 (dCH3_HfC). Occurred 1/5 times (fwd/rev).
    Fastest equilibrated step: Elementary steps 67/68 (bCH_HfC). Occurred 19030/18987 times (fwd/rev), 7.60340000000000% of total events.

    At least one non-equilibrated step has occurred (Case 1):
        Elementary steps 67/68 (bCH_HfC): Occurred 19030/18987 times (fwd/rev), too fast. StiffCoeffNew/Old = 0.657687337204513
        No equilibrated steps are too slow.
