# Welcome to ZacrosTools Documentation

Welcome to the ZacrosTools documentation! This guide provides comprehensive information on using the ZacrosTools Python library.

ZacrosTools is a versatile toolkit designed to simplify the preparation and analysis of Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations with **[Zacros](https://zacros.org/)**.

### Key Features:
- **User-friendly:** Simplifies the creation, execution, and analysis of Zacros simulations with intuitive Python functions and classes.
- **Automated Input Generation:** Generates Zacros input files for pressure or temperature scans, reducing the risk of errors and speeding up the setup process.
- **Result Analysis Tools:** Provides powerful tools for analyzing Zacros simulation outputs, including multiple plotting functions.
- **Extensibility:** Easily integrates with other Python libraries and tools, enabling seamless incorporation into broader computational workflows.
- **Documentation and Examples:** Extensive documentation is available, including detailed examples to help users quickly get started and make the most of ZacrosTools.
